# Aid El Adha Donation App - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Al Insan - Aid El Adha Donation Platform  
**Team:** Junction App Development Team  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Platform:** Flutter (Cross-platform mobile application)

## Project Description

Al Insan is a comprehensive donation platform designed specifically for Aid El Adha (Eid al-Adha) celebrations. The application facilitates the donation of sacrificial animals (sheep, cows, goats, and camels) to families in need, with a unique automated video recording system that provides transparency and trust to donors.

### Core Mission
- Enable donors to contribute to Aid El Adha sacrifices
- Provide transparent verification through automated video recording
- Ensure proper distribution of meat to needy families
- Support Islamic charitable giving with modern technology

## Key Features

### 1. Animal Donation System
- **Supported Animals:** Sheep (Mouton), Cows (Vache), Goats (ChÃ¨vre), Camels (Chameau)
- **Pricing Structure:**
  - Sheep: 25,000 DA
  - Cow: 150,000 DA
  - Goat: 35,000 DA
  - Camel: 200,000 DA
- **Animal Information:** Origin, estimated age, weight, distribution details

### 2. Automated Video Recording System
**Innovation:** Gesture-controlled video recording for transparency

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Gesture Recognition:** Hand gesture detection for automated video control
- **Recording Workflow:**
  1. Recording starts automatically when sacrifice begins
  2. Specific hand gesture stops recording for donor transition
  3. Another gesture resumes recording for next donor
  4. Each donor receives their personalized video segment

#### Gesture Commands:
- **Stop Recording:** Specific hand gesture (to be defined)
- **Start Recording:** Different hand gesture (to be defined)
- **No Touch Required:** Completely hands-free operation

#### Video Processing:
- Automatic segmentation based on gesture detection
- Individual video files for each donor
- Quality verification before distribution

### 3. User Interface Features
- **Multi-language Support:** French and Arabic
- **Animal Selection Grid:** Visual selection with images
- **Donation Tracking:** Real-time status updates
- **Messaging System:** Communication between donors and administrators
- **Profile Management:** User account and donation history

### 4. Distribution System
- **Recipients:** Orphans, needy families, social centers
- **Delivery Time:** 2-4 days after payment confirmation
- **Geographic Coverage:** Algeria (Tiaret, Djelfa regions)
