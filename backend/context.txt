This app is for a charity organization focused on helping poor people in Africa by facilitating the donation of money to buy "أضحية العيد" (Eid sacrifice animals).

**Key Features:**
- Users can buy one or more "أضحية" (sacrifice animals). The available types are:
  - Sheep (خروف)
  - Mouton (كبش)
  - Cow (بقرة)
  - Camel (جمل)
- Each type of animal has a fixed price.
- Users can also contribute any amount of money they wish. When enough people contribute and the total reaches the price of an animal, the animal will be purchased.
- Users can choose which type of animal they want their contribution to go towards (e.g., cow, sheep, etc.).

**Payment Methods:**
- PayPal
- Baridimob (via the app or WhatsApp, with proof of payment sent)
- Dounapay
- CIB (bank card)

**Proof of Payment:**
- Users can send proof of payment directly through the app.
- Alternatively, users can contact the organization on WhatsApp and send proof of payment (for Baridimob or CIB).

**Security and Verification:**
- For security, users must upload a photo of their ID card or passport to confirm their identity.
- The organization compares the user's name with the name on the payment proof to ensure the payment was made by the user.

**After Payment Verification:**
- Once payment is verified, the user can choose how to receive the video of their "أضحية":
  - Via WhatsApp
  - Through the app

**Note:** The app only answers questions based on the information above.
